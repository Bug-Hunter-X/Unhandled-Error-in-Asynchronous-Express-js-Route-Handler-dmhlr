# Unhandled Error in Asynchronous Express.js Route Handler

This repository demonstrates a common error in Node.js applications using Express.js: unhandled errors within asynchronous route handlers.  The code simulates an asynchronous operation that might fail, throwing an error within a `setTimeout` callback.  This error is not caught, resulting in the application crashing without providing a proper error response to the client.

The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version that properly handles the error using `try...catch` blocks and sends an appropriate error response to the client.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the directory.
3. Run `npm install express`
4. Run `node bug.js`.
5. Observe the application crash or unexpected behavior.
6. Then run `node bugSolution.js` and see the improved error handling.

## Solution

The solution involves using `try...catch` to handle potential errors within the asynchronous operation.  This prevents the application from crashing and allows for sending a meaningful error response to the client.
